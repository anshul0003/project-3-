Project Title
ConditionalContract - Ethereum Smart Contract Example

Description
The ConditionalContract project demonstrates the implementation of a basic Ethereum smart contract using Solidity. It showcases the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements for condition checking and error handling within decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows for depositing Ether, withdrawing Ether by the contract owner, checking the contract balance, and intentionally triggering an exception for demonstration purposes.

Getting Started
Installing

To interact with the smart contract:

Download or Clone Repository:

Clone the repository from GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/exampleuser/conditional-contract.git
Setup Environment:

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
Install Truffle (a development framework for Ethereum) globally:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g truffle
Executing Program

Compile Smart Contract:

Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd conditional-contract
Compile the smart contract:
bash
Copy code
truffle compile
Deploy Smart Contract:

Edit truffle-config.js or truffle.js to set up your development network (e.g., using Ganache).
Deploy the smart contract:
bash
Copy code
truffle migrate --network development
Interact with the Contract:

Use Truffle console to interact with the deployed contract:
bash
Copy code
truffle console
Example commands in Truffle console:
javascript
Copy code
let instance = await ConditionalContract.deployed();
let balance = await instance.getBalance();
console.log("Contract balance:", balance.toNumber());
Help
If you encounter issues during setup or deployment:

Double-check that Node.js, npm, and Truffle are correctly installed and up-to-date.
Ensure your development environment (like Ganache) is running if deploying to a local blockchain.
